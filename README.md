# Music_Recommendation_System
We all love listening to music, donâ€™t we? But no amount of music is ever
enough for us. We always want to discover new artists, new music and new
tones to satisfy our music cravings. The motivation behind selecting the music
recommendation system as our project stems from its unique blend of practical
utility and intellectual exploration. While acknowledging its prevalence, we
recognize the profound opportunities it presents for harnessing our theoretical
machine learning knowledge into a tangible application. By crafting a system
that aspires to match the quality of established platforms like YouTube and
Spotify, we aim to decipher the intricacies of recommendation algorithms,
diving deep into content-based filtering, and real-time learning.
Our aim is to make a personalised recommendation system for a user to enhance
the music listening experience for everyone. We believe that this project is a
tool that resonates with genuine utility and will give us a chance to apply all our
machine learning knowledge to real-world use.
This project presents a Content-Based Music Recommendation System that
suggests songs based on their audio features such as acousticness, danceability,
energy, and tempo. The system uses feature correlation, clustering, and cosine
similarity to find the most relevant recommendations. The dataset used for
training is pre-processed and analysed using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
to derive meaningful insights. The model then employs Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) and K-Means Clustering to group similar songs, followed by
Cosine Similarity to generate personalized recommendations.

# Aims & Objectives:
To develop a content-based filtering system for music recommendation.
To analyze audio features and determine their correlation with popularity.
To implement PCA and clustering techniques for song similarity.
To generate accurate and personalized music recommendations.
To visualize the data using graphs and charts for better understanding.
# Scope
The recommendation system can be integrated into music streaming applications
to enhance user experience. It can also be extended to provide recommendations
for playlist generation, background scoring, or DJ set planning.
